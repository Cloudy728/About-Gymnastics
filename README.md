    <h2>A little more about it</h2>
	<p> Gymnastics is a sport with different and complicated moves. For this sport, you will constantly have to practice and practice. This is because many of the moves you will do will probably include flexibility. Some of the starter moves may be backbend, cartwheel, and splits.
    Many people try gymnastics but find it hard. This is because you constantly have to stretch and really challenge yourself. It will also take up a lot of your time and energy. It may also be easier to start when you are younger. Since babies and younger kids have softer bones, you will find it easy to bend and twist yourself in ways that would be difficult otherwise.
    You will also have bars, floor, and beam for higher-level gymnastics. In gymnastics, we also have moves like swinging off bars and landing perfectly. One of the easy passes for the floor would be running, then doing a cartwheel going into two backhand springs, and ending off with a backflip, which would need lots of practice and bravery. And it is only an easy pass!
    In gymnastics, though you will have teams and rounds just like other sports it is a little bit different because sure you can practice together and have fun but you won't need to socialize with other people. You can just practice on your own and be just as good. It doesn't mean that you won't be in teams and all but my point is that you just don't HAVE TO be with other people to be that good.</p>
